/**
 * This class handles the conversion from a normal expression tree into
 * the CNF form. Basically it will follow these steps:
 * 
 * To help understanding, I will generate an example:
 * Here is the original tree:
 *                   OR
 *             /            \
 *            OR            NOT
 *         /     \           |
 *       NOT      H         AND
 *        |                /   \
 *       NOT              G    OR
 *        |                   /  \
 *        F                  H   NOT
 *                                |
 *                               OR
 *                             /    \
 *                            AND    L
 *                           /   \
 *                         ( )   ( )
 *                          |     |
 *                          J     K
 *                          
 * 1. rebuild the tree by replacing the "and" and "or" operators 
 * (which are binary) into their counterparts node that could hold 
 * multiple elements. Also, leave out the parenthesis node to
 * make the tree uniform.
 * 
 * After the transform, the result should be like this:
 *                   OR(M)
 *             /            \
 *            OR(M)         NOT
 *         /     \           |
 *       NOT      H         AND(M)
 *        |                /   \
 *       NOT              G    OR(M)
 *        |                   /  \
 *        F                  H   NOT
 *                                |
 *                               OR(M)
 *                             /    \
 *                            AND(M)  L
 *                           /   \
 *                          J     K
 * 
 * 2. push the not operators into the bottom of the expression. That
 * means the not operator will be the root of the expression tree
 * where no "and" or "or" exists. Be sure use the De Morgan's law
 * and double not law.
 * 
 * How to use De Morgan law:
 * For example, here is the original expression tree:
 *                NOT
 *                 |
 *                AND(M)
 *              /     \
 *             G       H
 *             
 * After we use the De Morgan law, the result should be like this:
 *                OR(M)
 *              /     \
 *            NOT     NOT
 *             |       |
 *             G       H
 * 
 * After the transform, the result should be like this:
 *                   OR(M)
 *              /             \
 *            OR(M)           OR(M)    
 *          /    \          /       \
 *         F      H       NOT       AND(M)
 *                         |       /   \
 *                         G      NOT  OR(M)
 *                                 |  /     \
 *                                 H AND(M)  L
 *                                   /  \
 *                                  J    K
 *  
 * 3. gather all the adjacent "and" or "or" operator together.
 * After doing that, the expression tree will be presented as:
 * all the and expression will be in either odd or even levels,
 * this will be the same for the or operator.
 * 
 * After the transform, the expression tree should be like this:
 *                         OR(M)
 *               /     /         \     \
 *              F     H          NOT   AND(M)
 *                                |   /    \
 *                                G  NOT   OR(M)
 *                                    |   /   \ 
 *                                    H  AND(M) L
 *                                      /     \
 *                                     J       K
 *  
 * 4. push the and operator upwards until the root is an and 
 * operator and all the children are or operators with multiple
 * components. At this time we get the result: an expression in CNF form.
 * How do we push and up? Use distribution law!
 *  
 * For example, here is the way to push the and up and merge them.
 *                       OR
 *                    /      \
 *                  AND       L
 *                /     \
 *               J       K
 *               
 * In the normal form, it could be: (J AND K) OR L.
 * If we apply the distribution law, we will get the result like this:
 * (J OR L) AND (K OR L), the tree form of this should be like:
 *                     AND
 *                   /     \
 *                  OR     OR
 *                /   \   /   \
 *               J     L K     L
 *               
 * So after we push the AND at the deepest level up and merge it with the 
 * existing add, we get this result.
 *                     OR(M)
 *           /     /         \              \
 *          F     H          NOT            AND(M)
 *                            |      /       |       \
 *                            G    NOT      OR(M)    OR(M)
 *                                  |      /    \   /    \
 *                                  H     J     L  K      L 
 * 
 * Now let us push the and up and we will get the result like this:
 *                             AND(M)
 *             /                |                 \
 *            OR(M)             OR(M)             OR(M)
 *     /    /   \   \    /   /  |   \   \    /  /  |   \  \
 *    F    H    NOT NOT  F  H  NOT  J   L   F  H  NOT  K   L
 *               |   |          |                  |
 *               G   H          G                  G
