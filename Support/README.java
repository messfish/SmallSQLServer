package Support;

/**
 * This package serves as the support for all kinds of requirements.
 * In this package, there will be a catalog that converts all the 
 * scheme of the existing tables, a helper class to transform the 
 * data into binary form in order to be used for the java nio.
 * Of course, there will be a class to convert the binary data into
 * human readable data. Last may not be the least, this class stores
 * the B+ Tree files in two ways: one is the static B+ Tree which 
 * deals with bulk loading, the other is the dynamic B+ Tree which is 
 * used for common writings. Also, there will be a tuple class that
 * stores all types of data in a special way.
